# Patient-Billing-Software
It's a billing model which gives all calculations of a patient in a hospital.
This system is providing the facility of viewing all informationabout patients
details, their admit time and the amount to be paid based on the treatment
given and the ward selected. We can register all the patient details like the
amount to be paid / any balance remaining, the ward number, the bed
number, the registration number, case number etc. as soon as a new patient
is joined in the hospital
